Multi is the result of 4 months of solo work. It is a networked first person shooter where you can choose your character's class. Each class has a different weapon and ultimate attack so its own play style.
I made the models for this game and the animations. It was a first for me to work so much on the graphic aspect. The creation of this game also made me progress in the field of multiplayer.
