I made this game as part of my course at the Ecole Centrale de Lille. I had to give myself a challenge to accomplish over a period of 1 year. So I chose to make a video game.

Hourglass Paradox is a first-person puzzle game inspired by Portal but very different. The ability of your character allows you to reverse gravity in the rooms. This ability as well as the different objects you can collect should allow you to solve a lot of puzzles (like in Portal, the first one, you go through rooms and have to reach the exit).
