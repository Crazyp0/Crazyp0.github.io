Crumble Tumble is a game that was created during the TUFR Jam 2. My brother and I had 48 hours to make a game on the theme Alea Jacta Est. The models and the UI were made by us.

The goal of the game is to go through archipelagos in order to fight the living dead. You have to draw the path you want to follow to try to reach the end of each archipelago while dodging the living dead. Moreover, you can anticipate the enemies' movements. The game is rather short (about ten levels including the initiation levels) but we are very satisfied for a first game jam.
