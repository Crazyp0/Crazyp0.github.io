Brief presentation
======

Hi, my name is Matthieu,
A strong taste for sciences and mathematics initially guided my decision to do a preparatory class in math and physics, which I did at the lycée Marcelin Berthelot in Saint Maur des Fossés.

I then entered the Ecole Centrale de Lille where I spent 2 years.
I am now in double degree with the university of Lille where I study data science. 

About me
======

In addition to studying data science, I am passionate about creating video games.
You can find more info about my creations in the portfolio tab.
I also provide you with my resume if you are interested
